== Self-documenting services

The https://github.com/cer/microservice-canvas[microservice canvas] is a great way to document a service.
One drawback, however, is that like all forms of documentation, it often becomes out of date.

This project keeps the canvas up to date by dynamically generating a microservice canvas for a running service using a combination of reflection/introspection and explicit metadata.

You can access a service's canvas via the following endpoints:

* `/canvas.adoc` - returns the Asciidoc canvas
* `/canvas.html` - returns the HTML canvas
* `/canvas.json` - returns the JSON representation of a canvas
* `/canvas.yml` - returns the YAML representation of a canvas

=== Supported frameworks

The following frameworks are supported:

* Spring Boot
* Eventuate Tram
* Eventuate Tram sagas

=== How it works

The canvas is built from the following sources:

|===
| Source | Provides
| `${spring.application.name}` | Service name
| Bean in `ApplicationContext` annotated with `@ServiceDescription` | Service name and capabilities
| `@Controllers` in the Spring `ApplicationContext` | Synchronous API operations
| Eventuate Tram command handlers | Asynchronous API operations
| Eventuate Tram domain event handlers | Event subscription dependencies
| Eventuate Tram Saga saga participant proxy beans| Asynchronous dependencies
|===


=== Getting started

image::https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.microservices.tools.canvas/microservice-canvas-tools[]


First, you need to this dependency `io.microservices.tools.canvas:microservice-canvas-springmvc:LATEST_VERSION`.

Second, `@Import` `MicroserviceCanvasWebConfiguration`.

Finally, add these optional dependencies:

|===
| If you are using | Then add this dependency
| Eventuate Tram | `io.microservices.tools.canvas:microservice-canvas-extractor-tram:LATEST_VERSION`
| Eventuate Tram Sagas | `io.microservices.tools.canvas:microservice-canvas-extractor-tram-sagas:LATEST_VERSION`
|===


=== Example usage

= An Eventuate project

This project is part of http://eventuate.io[Eventuate], which is a microservices collaboration platform.

This https://github.com/microservices-patterns/ftgo-application/commit/776d5fcab4bb45416f487f733380630468df5933[commit] adds canvas support to the https://github.com/microservices-patterns/ftgo-application[FTGO application's Order Service].
